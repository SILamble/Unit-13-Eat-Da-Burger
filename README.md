# Unit-13-Eat-Da-Burger

## Outline

A web application that allows content to be saved to a database and displayed on screen, the database content can be updated changing the how it is displayed on screen. 

## User Story

As the owner of a burger restaurant I accept any burger orders from customers, which will be listed once received, when the burger is eaten the list is updated and the burger choice moves to the "devoured" side of the page.

## MVP

Users can input burger details on screen, the burgers will be displayed on screen with a button, when the button is clicked the burger will move to the other screen. 

## Future Content

App is fully deployed to Heroku, user builds burgers from list of ingredients and the name is assigned to it automatically based on ingredients.
